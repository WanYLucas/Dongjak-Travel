# 🔧 Git + AI Workflow Rules

## Branching
- Keep `main` stable.
- Create feature branches as `ai-<feature>` for AI-assisted tasks.

## Auto-Commit 🤖
- Auto-commit script watches file changes and commits in Korean using Conventional Commits style.
- Commands:
  - One-shot commit: `npm run ai:commit-once`
  - Watch and auto-commit: `npm run ai:autocommit`

## Commit Message Style ✍️
- Prefer Conventional Commits: `feat|fix|chore|refactor|docs|style: summary`.
- The auto-commit uses: `chore: 자동 커밋 (AI 작업 감지)` and lists changed files in Korean.

## Pull Requests
- Push feature branches and open PRs to `main`.
- Keep PRs small and focused; include a summary of UI changes and screenshots if relevant.
